# GitHub Setup Without Git CLI

If you can't install Git locally, you can still upload your project to GitHub using the web interface.

## Method 1: GitHub Web Upload

### Step 1: Create Repository
1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and sign in
2. Click "+" → "New repository"
3. Name: `voltservers`
4. Make it **Public** (required for free Render deployment)
5. **Don't** initialize with README/gitignore
6. Click "Create repository"

### Step 2: Upload Files
1. Click "uploading an existing file" link
2. Drag and drop your entire project folder OR
3. Click "choose your files" and select all project files
4. **Important**: Don't upload these folders/files:
   - `node_modules/` (too large)
   - `.env` (contains secrets)
   - `dist/` (build output)
   - `.vscode/` (optional, but included in .gitignore)

### Step 3: Commit Files
1. Scroll down to "Commit new files"
2. Title: "Initial commit: VoltServers game hosting platform"
3. Click "Commit new files"

## Method 2: GitHub Desktop (GUI Alternative)

### Step 1: Install GitHub Desktop
1. Download from [desktop.github.com](https://desktop.github.com)
2. Install and sign in with your GitHub account

### Step 2: Create Repository
1. File → New Repository
2. Name: `voltservers`
3. Local Path: Choose your project folder
4. Click "Create Repository"

### Step 3: Publish to GitHub
1. Click "Publish repository"
2. Make sure "Keep this code private" is **unchecked**
3. Click "Publish repository"

## Method 3: VS Code GitHub Integration

### Step 1: Install VS Code Extensions
1. Install "GitHub Pull Requests and Issues" extension
2. Install "GitLens" extension (optional)

### Step 2: Initialize Repository
1. Open your project in VS Code
2. Go to Source Control panel (Ctrl+Shift+G)
3. Click "Initialize Repository"
4. Stage all files (click + next to changes)
5. Type commit message: "Initial commit"
6. Click checkmark to commit

### Step 3: Publish to GitHub
1. Click "Publish to GitHub"
2. Choose "Public repository"
3. VS Code will create the repository and push your code

## What Files to Include

Make sure these files are uploaded:
```
✅ Include:
- package.json
- package-lock.json
- render.yaml
- tsconfig.json
- vite.config.ts
- tailwind.config.ts
- postcss.config.js
- components.json
- drizzle.config.ts
- All .md files (README, guides, etc.)
- client/ folder (all contents)
- server/ folder (all contents)
- shared/ folder (all contents)
- .gitignore

❌ Don't Include:
- node_modules/
- dist/
- .env
- .vscode/ (optional)
```

## After Upload: Deploy to Render

1. Go to [Render Dashboard](https://dashboard.render.com)
2. New → Blueprint
3. Connect your GitHub repository
4. Render will automatically detect `render.yaml`
5. Deploy your application

## Troubleshooting

### File Size Issues
- GitHub has file size limits
- node_modules/ is too large (that's why we don't upload it)
- Render will run `npm install` automatically

### Missing Files
- If you forget files, you can upload them later
- Go to your repository → Add file → Upload files

### Private vs Public Repository
- **Must be Public** for free Render deployment
- Private repos require paid Render plan

Your VoltServers application will be deployed and running once you complete any of these methods!
