## Step-by-Step Deployment Instructions

### 1. Build the Static Website
```bash
cd client
npm run build
```

### 2. Upload Files to NameCheap
1. **Access cPanel**: Log into your NameCheap hosting account
2. **Open File Manager**: Navigate to the `public_html` folder
3. **Upload Files**: Upload ALL contents from `client/dist/` folder to `public_html/`
4. **Important Files to Include**:
   - `index.html` (main file)
   - `assets/` folder (contains CSS and JavaScript)
   - `images/` folder (contains game images)
   - `.htaccess` file (enables proper routing)

### 3. Verify Upload
Make sure these files are in your `public_html` directory:
```
public_html/
├── index.html
├── .htaccess
├── assets/
│   ├── index-[hash].css
│   └── index-[hash].js
└── images/
    └── games/
        ├── minecraft.svg
        ├── rust.svg
        └── cs2.svg
```

### 4. Test Your Website
- Visit your domain (e.g., `https://yourdomain.com`)
- Navigate to different pages (About, Games, Pricing, etc.)
- Verify all images and styling load correctly

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: Pages show 404 errors when navigating
**Solution**: Ensure `.htaccess` file is uploaded and contains:
```apache
RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /
RewriteRule ^index\.html$ - [L]
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule . /index.html [L]
```

### Problem: Images not loading
**Solution**: Make sure the `images/` folder is uploaded to the root directory

### Problem: CSS/Styling not working
**Solution**: Verify the `assets/` folder with CSS files is uploaded

## Adding Contact Form Functionality

Since the backend won't work on shared hosting, you can add a working contact form using Formspree:

1. **Sign up** at [formspree.io](https://formspree.io) (free tier available)
2. **Create a form** and get your form endpoint
3. **Update contact page** to use the Formspree endpoint
4. **Test form submissions**

## Performance Optimization

Your static site on NameCheap shared hosting will be:
- ⚡ **Fast loading** (no server processing)
- 🌍 **SEO friendly** (fully crawlable by search engines)
- 💰 **Cost effective** (works with basic shared hosting)
- 🔒 **Secure** (no backend to compromise)

## Upgrading to Full Functionality

If you need the admin panel and database features later, consider:
- **Render.com** (free tier available)
- **Railway.app** ($5/month)
- **Vercel** (free with limitations)

These platforms support the full Node.js application with all features intact.
