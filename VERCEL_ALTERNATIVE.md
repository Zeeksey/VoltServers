# Alternative: Deploy to Railway (Easier Option)

If Vercel continues to have configuration issues, Railway is an excellent alternative that's more straightforward for Express.js applications.

## Why Railway?
✅ **Simpler Configuration**: No complex config files needed
✅ **Express.js Friendly**: Built for Node.js backends
✅ **PostgreSQL Integration**: One-click database setup
✅ **GitHub Integration**: Automatic deployments
✅ **Free Tier**: $5/month credit included

## Quick Railway Setup:

1. **Visit [Railway.app](https://railway.app)**
2. **Sign in with GitHub**
3. **New Project → Deploy from GitHub**
4. **Select your voltservers repository**
5. **Add PostgreSQL**: Click "Add Plugin" → PostgreSQL
6. **Set Environment Variables**:
   ```
   DATABASE_URL=(automatically provided by Railway)
   SESSION_SECRET=your_random_secret
   WHMCS_API_URL=https://voltservers.com/billing/
   WHMCS_API_IDENTIFIER=your_whmcs_identifier
   WHMCS_API_SECRET=your_whmcs_secret
   ```

Railway will automatically:
- Run `npm install` and `npm run build`
- Start your app with `npm start`
- Provide a public URL
- Handle SSL certificates
- Auto-deploy on GitHub pushes

Much simpler than Vercel configuration issues!
