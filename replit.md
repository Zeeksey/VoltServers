# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture
The client-side is built with React and TypeScript, using Vite for development and build. UI components are from shadcn/ui (built on Radix UI primitives) and styled with Tailwind CSS, following a custom gaming theme. Wouter is used for client-side routing, and TanStack Query for data fetching and caching. The design follows a component-based architecture. Content is organized into dedicated pages like `/enterprise`, `/dashboard`, `/client-portal`, `/minecraft`, `/knowledgebase`, and `/contact` to improve navigation.

## Backend Architecture
The server is implemented using Express.js with TypeScript, following a RESTful API design pattern. It uses an in-memory storage implementation with interfaces designed for easy migration to persistent storage. Routes are organized by resource type with consistent error handling.

## Database Layer
The application uses Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL as the target database, currently implementing an in-memory storage pattern. The schema is well-defined with proper typing, including tables for users, games, pricing plans, server status, server locations, Minecraft tools, game page sections, features, and plans.

## Data Management
State management uses TanStack Query for server state and React's built-in state for UI state. Data flows from backend REST endpoints to frontend components, with proper loading states and error boundaries.

## UI/UX Design System
A comprehensive design system uses shadcn/ui components with a custom gaming theme. Color schemes include gaming-specific variables and support light/dark modes. The design emphasizes visual hierarchy, responsive layouts, and accessible interactions.

## Development Tooling
The project uses TypeScript for type safety, ESLint for code quality, and Vite for fast development builds.
